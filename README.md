# Sounds App

## Goal

In this project, I dived more into Dart programming concepts and learned how to use open source Flutter packages. 
By the end of this project, I became comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What I created

I made an app that plays short movie sounds based on the occasion.
